<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Chocolate Chip Cookies are classic homemade treats loved by everyone. They are soft, chewy, and loaded with gooey chocolate chips.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
    <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
    <li>1 cup packed brown sugar</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>2 cups semisweet chocolate chips</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.</li>
    <li>In a large mixing bowl, cream together softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy.</li>
    <li>Beat in eggs, one at a time, then stir in vanilla extract.</li>
    <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together all-purpose flour, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined.</li>
    <li>Fold in semisweet chocolate chips until evenly distributed throughout the dough.</li>
    <li>Drop tablespoon-sized balls of dough onto prepared baking sheets, leaving some space between each cookie.</li>
    <li>Bake in preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until edges are golden brown. Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring to wire racks to cool completely.</li>
    <li>Enjoy warm or store in an airtight container for later indulgence!</li>
